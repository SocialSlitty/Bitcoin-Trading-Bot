## 2024-12-23 - [Pandas Loop Optimization]
**Learning:** Iterating through a Pandas DataFrame using `.iloc` inside a loop is a significant performance bottleneck because it creates a new Series object for each row.
**Action:** Always pre-extract columns to NumPy arrays (`df['col'].values`) before iterating if row-by-row processing is required (e.g., for stateful simulations). This simple change can yield 4x-100x speedups.

## 2025-12-30 - [Vectorized Simulation]
**Learning:** Replacing iterative `for` loops with NumPy vectorization (e.g., `np.cumsum`, `np.exp`) for stochastic processes like Geometric Brownian Motion is dramatically faster but alters the random number generation sequence compared to iterative calls, even with the same seed.
**Action:** When vectorizing simulations, verify that strict deterministic reproduction of the *exact same* path isn't required by downstream tests, or accept that the "same seed" will produce a statistically equivalent but numerically different path.

## 2026-01-22 - [Vectorized Date Formatting]
**Learning:** Formatting dates inside a loop using `pd.Timestamp.strftime` is extremely slow (Python overhead). Using `np.datetime_as_string(dates, unit='D')` on the entire array is ~8x faster.
**Action:** Pre-format date strings using NumPy vectorization before entering any display or logging loop. Use `.astype(object)` if you need native Python strings.
